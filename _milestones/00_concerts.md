Focusing on providing effective demand-augmentation/awareness capacity on the planning of the future online + regular concerts and festivals. 

Via this development branch, a concept, called ["event(demand)-upon-stream"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKhhBP57Tzc) will be implemented to connect those demanding a concert with a given future period to keep an active status.

Audience is planned to give a time period ahead to artists, via setting a "demand-on-air" period (eg. 2-3 years) as part of their demand's preferrables. 

The aim is to enable artists directly, and other audiences, potential event hosts/broadcasters and NGOs of causes to observe the collective demand and collectible charitable amounts, from the events of the artists or genres.

(this is the initial design to be refined)
