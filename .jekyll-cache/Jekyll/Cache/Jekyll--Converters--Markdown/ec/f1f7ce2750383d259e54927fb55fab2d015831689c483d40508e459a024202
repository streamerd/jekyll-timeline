I"•<p>Focusing on providing effective demand-augmentation/awareness capacity on the planning of the future online + regular concerts and festivals.</p>

<p>Via this development branch, a concept, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKhhBP57Tzc">â€œevent(demand)-upon-streamâ€</a> will be implemented to connect those demanding a concert with a given future period to keep an active status.</p>

<p>Audience is planned to give a time period ahead to artists, via setting a â€œdemand-on-airâ€ period (eg. 2-3 years) as part of their demandâ€™s preferrables.</p>

<p>The aim is to enable artists directly, and other audiences, potential event hosts/broadcasters and NGOs of causes to observe the collective demand and collectible charitable amounts, from the events of the artists or genres.</p>

<p>(this is the initial design to be refined)</p>
